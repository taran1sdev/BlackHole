# BlackHole

I started this project to continue learning low-level programming and apply the concepts I learned during HNC Computational Thinking using C++ and OpenGL to render 3D objects, build a simple ray tracing engine, work with shaders and apply effects like gravitational lensing.

Also black holes are cool..
